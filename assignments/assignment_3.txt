1. area of shapes
abstract class Shape
{
	double area;
	
}


Circle: pi*r*r;
	- radius
	- public void CalculateArea(){}

Triangle:0.5*b*h;
	- tBase
	- tHeight
	- public void CalculateArea(){}

double CalculateArea()
void CalculateArea()

Rules: inside the Circle and Triangle class codes you can't write any CW or CR

2. oustanding person

abstract Person:
	- name
	- public abstract bool IsOutstanding();

concrete Author:Person	
	- number of books publised
	- public override bool IsOutstanding(){}
	- string Print(){}

concrete Student:Person
	- marks obtained
	- public override bool IsOutstanding()
	- string Show(){}
