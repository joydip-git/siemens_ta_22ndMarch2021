1. create a class => Student
2. No data members, just a method which will accept name of student and marks. This method calculates the average of marks and returns the same back to Main method, when called.
3. create two student objects in Main
4. call the Student class's method
max possible number of marks: 5
min possible number of marks: 0
no of arguments >=0 and <=5

2. complete the Employee app:
Now, create an array which will store reference of several employee objects (say, 4)
accept values from user console
create separate method for that and in that method create individual employee instance and return the same in Main, where you will store that reference in the created array

after that iterate through the array, pick up one employee at a time and print the salary along with name of that employee
Salary of <emp_name1> is <emp-salary1>
Salary of <emp_name2> is <emp-salary2>
Salary of <emp_name3> is <emp-salary3>
Salary of <emp_name4> is <emp-salary4>

3. complete the last assignment of Assignment_1 (regarding array)

4. Create two child classes of Employee class: Hr and Developer
	Hr: gratuityPay
	Developer: incentivePay, project name

	Use the inherited method to calculate salary in these child classes and then change the code in that method

	public void CalculateSalary(){}

	create now 2 Hr and 2 Developer class objects
	store them in repo
	calculate salary
	iterate through the repo and print name with salary
