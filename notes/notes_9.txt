sorting:
	- internalization: the logic for comparison between two elements in a collection is written inside the element itself
		- IComparable => int CompareTo(object obj) [System]
		- IComparable<in T> => int CompareTo(T other) [System]
		Implement anyone of these interfaces in the element
		Then you can call Sort() method of collection where those element instances are present

	- externalization: the logic for comparison between two elements in a collection is written outside the element, at a separate place
		- IComparer => int Compare(object x, object y) [System.Collections]
		- IComparer<in T> => int Compare(T x, T y) [System.Collections.Generic]
		Implement anyone of these interfaces in an external class (NOT the element itself, which are being compared)
		Create an instance of the comparer class which has implemented any of the above two interfaces
		Then you can call Sort() method of collection where those element instances are present and pass the instance of comparer class as an argument

Callback Mechanism:
----------------------------------------
//1, declare prototype of the function
bool IsEven(int x)

Foo()
{
	//2. create an object of some class who can store address of that function
	//3. pass the object to Foo2
	//Foo2(reference to Foo1)
	Foo2(reference of IsEven)
}
Foo1()
{
}
Foo2(reference of a method[bool <name>(int number)])
{
	 reference of a method();
}

a. Threading --> Tasks and Asynchronous method invocation
b. Plain Callback
c. Event handling
d. LINQ


Delegate: how to refer a method, how to invoke that method using the reference of the method
