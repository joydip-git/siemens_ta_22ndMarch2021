1. static members
2. Object class and it's methods:
	Equals (virtual)
	GetHashCode (virtual)
	ToString (virtual)
	GetType
3. namespace
4. method argument related keywords (ref, out)
5. enum
6. struct
7. sealed

a. without creating any instance lets'assign the value to static data member(s)
	 - use static property or method to assign value before any object is created

b. or, when the first instance is created, then the static member(s) is/are assigned value. 
	- write a constructor in the class which will be responsible to assign value to ONLY static member(s) and also that constructor needs to be executed ONLY ONCE, during the first instance/object creation, will NOT be invoked next time onwards when you create further instances

		-- Static constructor
			- you do not use any access specifier with it, NOT even public			
			- this ctor is not invoked explicitly while creating instance 
			- this ctor can't be overloaded
			- will be responsible to assign value to ONLY static member(s)
			- executed ONLY ONCE, during the first instance/object creation or even before any instance creation provided you have used the class (may be you have called a static property or a static method), will NOT be invoked next time onwards when you create further instances

c. field (data member) initialization

Now after this no matter you create thousands of objects, the static member(s) will NOT be assigned value anymore.

You need one time value assignment to static member(s)



static --> data member, constructor, proprty, method
who can assign value to static and const (which is by default static) and non-static members within the class?
