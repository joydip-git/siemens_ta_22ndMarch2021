1. constructor execution sequence, base keyword
2. polymorphism
3. virtual and override keyword
4. abstract
5. conversion between RTs

class A //:Object
{
	int x;
	public A(){}
	public A(int x){ this.x = x;}
}
clas B:A
{
	int y;
	public B(){}
	public B(int x, int y){ this.y = y;}
}

B obj = new B(10,20);

Ctor Execution Sequence: (Inheritance)
1. whenever you are calling a constructor (whichever) of a child class to create an instance (of child class), base class's default ctor will be invoked automatically (implicitly) by runtime
2. You can also instruct runtime to invoke any constructor of base class other than the default ctor, using 'base' keyword

SC -(csc)-> IL -(JIT)-> MLC

POLYMORPHISM:
	static: the static binding between the caller lines and called methods/operators is figured out during compilation phase. during runtime simply exact method(s)/operator(s) is(are) called.
	1. operator ovreloading: operators doing diffrerent operations depending on type of operands
		- "joy"+"mon" (concatination)
		//joy.concatenate(mon);
		- 12+10	(addition)
		//Math.Add(12,10)	


	method oevrloading: Methods with same name
	2. no inheritance involved
		- single class having methods with same name
		arguments:
			- number
			- data type
			- position
	dynamic:which method will be called is decided during rutime
	3. inheritance involved
		- base and child having ditto same method (method with same signature - arguments, name, return type all same)
		- difference lies in implementation (code inside the method)

			Device: virtual void Type()

Mobile:Device		Laptop:Device		Desktop:Device		TypeWriter:Device
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//void Type(){}		//void Type(){}		//void Type(){}		//void Type(){}
override void Type(){}	override void Type(){}	override void Type(){}	override void Type(){}

			Person: virtual void Cut()
Butcher			HairStylist		FilmDirector
----------------------------------------------------------------------
void Cut()		void Cut()		void Cut()
override void Cut(){}	override void Cut(){}	override void Cut(){}

Person p = new Butcher() Person p = new HairStylist() Person p = new FilmDirector().Cut()
p.Cut()			  p.Cut()			p.Cut()

virtual and override (override NOT overwrite)
	- base class method should be declared with virtual in orde to use override with same method in child
	- virtual is necessary for override
	- if base class method is vrtual that doesn't mean you have to mandatorily override the same method in the child (that means, virtual exists without override) 


inheritance is also way of making sure that every child class has same functionalities (As well as common data)
inheritance with dynamic polymorphism ensures that not only child classes have the same set of functionalities, but also child classes can provide new implementations of those set of functionalities if they want and then the child functionalities will be called (instead of base functionalities in case of upcasting)

DataAccess:
	- data
	- GetData();

SqlDataAccess:
	 - connectionPath (data member)
	 - data  (data member) 
	 - GetData (method)

XmlFileDataAccess
	- filePath (data member)
	- data (data member) 
	- GetData (method)


I want to make sure that every child class has same set of functionalities, and child classes must implement those (no longer optional, rather it's mandatory) as well as when the child class objects are created, the child class's methods will be invoked

abstract pattern:
	abstract class containing some abstract members
		- methods and properties (NOT constructor and data members)

Side-effect: you can't create instance of an abstract class, since there is atleast one abstract member
child classes must implement abstract members of abstract base class, otherwise they will become abstract class
override keyword to implement abstract members of abstract class in child class
