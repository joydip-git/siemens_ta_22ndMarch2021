1. namespace
2. Extension Method
3. generic - method, class, interface, generic with constraints
4. generic collection classes - List<T>, HashSet<T>, Dictionary<TKey,TValue> and SortedList<TKey,TValue>


1. Object class and it's methods:
	Equals (virtual)
	GetHashCode (virtual)
2. method argument related keywords (ref, out)
3. enum
4. struct
5. sealed
6. File Handling
7. Attributes
8. Exceptions
9. Delegates
10.LINQ
11. GC

C# 1.0 (2002) - Collection classes
ArrayList
HashTable
SortedList
Stack
Queue
......

a. unnecessary waste of time in case of boxing and unboxing
b. sorting the elements is really difficult
c. collection of heterogeneous elements all of which are boxed in Object data type
d. Sort method will throw exception if the collection is not of homogeneous elements

C# 2.0 (2005) - Generic Collection classes
List<T>
Dictionary<TKey,TValue>
SortedList<TKey,TValue>
Stack<T>
Queue<T>
HashSet<T>
........
a. NO unnecessary waste of time in case of boxing and unboxing
b. sorting the elements is really easy, just like an array
c. Sort method will NOT throw exception since the collection is of homogeneous elements
d. if not homogeneous elements you will get compilation error

Count poperty of Collection and generic collection Vs. Length of array
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Count returns exactly how many elements are present at a moment in a collection
Length simply tells you about the capacity of the array

C# 3.0 - LINQ concept was introduced
Extension Method - C# 3.0- 2007
	- create an utility class (declared with static keyword)
	- define the aditional methods (static here) whihc will be part of the target class
	- as the firt parameter in those additional methods, "this <class-name> arg" should be mentioned apart from other necessary parameters
	- Example:
		public static class CalcuationExtension
    		{       
        		public static int Multiply(this Calculation calculation, int a, int b)
        		{
           			return (a * b);
        		}
        		public static int Divide(this Calculation calculation, int a, int b)
        		{
            			return (a / b);
       			}
    		}
Namespace:
	- logical scope in a physical application to
		- segregate types (classes, interfaces, enums, structs, delegates etc.)
		- aggregate the types
			- putting types with similar nature (data access) together
				 - in the same assmebly under same namespace
				 - in different assemblies BUT under same namespace

Utility classes:
	- declared with static keyword
	- can have only static members (static data, ctor, proper, methods)
	- you can't create instance of this class (just like abstract class but for different reason and that is there is no instance member in this type of class)
	- Console, Convert etc.
